  medicARe aims to eliminate boring fitness training methodologies of traditional fitness apps by implementing immersive techniques using extended reality.<br>
- Immersive content with minimum prerequisites: A smartphone is all one requires to use medicARe.<br>
- Thus making 3D content readily available for everyone.<br>
- Remote education: To make biological studies more accessible while being immersive at the same time.

<h3>Make sure to check if your device is supporting ARcore :</h3> Link:  https://developers.google.com/ar/devices
<br>
<h3>How to use the project</h3>
1. The app can be simply downloaded from the repository link of the project .<br>
